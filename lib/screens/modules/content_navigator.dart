    } else if (item.title == 'Diving Equipment Overview') {
      return '''# Diving Equipment: Your Life Support System

Your diving equipment is more than just gearâ€”it's your life support system underwater. This lesson will help you understand each component, its purpose, and how to ensure it functions correctly.

## Core Diving Equipment

### Mask, Snorkel, and Fins

These basic items allow you to see clearly underwater, breathe at the surface without lifting your head, and move efficiently through water:

- **Mask**: Provides an air space in front of your eyes for clear vision
- **Snorkel**: Allows surface breathing while face-down in water
- **Fins**: Multiply your leg power for efficient movement underwater

### Exposure Protection
Your body loses heat 25 times faster in water than in air. Protection includes:

- **Wetsuits**: Made of neoprene, they trap a thin layer of water that your body heats
- **Drysuits**: Keep you completely dry, necessary for cold water diving
- **Gloves & Hoods**: Protect extremities in cooler conditions

### Buoyancy Control Device (BCD)
The BCD is a vest-like device that:

- Controls your buoyancy throughout the dive
- Holds your tank securely on your back
- Provides attachment points for accessories
- Inflates for positive buoyancy at the surface

### Regulator System

This critical equipment delivers breathable air from your high-pressure tank:

1. **First Stage**: Attaches to tank and reduces high pressure air
2. **Second Stage**: The mouthpiece that delivers air when you inhale
3. **Octopus**: Backup second stage for emergency air sharing
4. **Pressure Gauge**: Shows remaining air supply
5. **Depth Gauge**: Indicates current depth
6. **Dive Computer**: Tracks depth, time, and calculates no-decompression limits

## Equipment Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends the life of your equipment and ensures safety:

- Rinse all gear thoroughly with fresh water after each dive
- Allow equipment to dry completely before storage
- Store out of direct sunlight
- Have regulators professionally serviced annually
- Inspect all equipment before each dive

## Pre-Dive Equipment Check

Always perform the following checks before entering the water:

1. Turn on air and check tank pressure
2. Test all regulator functions
3. Check BCD inflation and deflation
4. Inspect mask, fins and exposure suit for damage
5. Verify all gauges and computer are functioning

Remember: Your life depends on your equipment underwater. Treat it with care and never dive with equipment you don't trust completely.''';
    } else if (item.title == 'Pre-Dive Safety Checks') {
      return '''# Pre-Dive Safety Checks: The Critical Final Step

The moments before entering the water are your last opportunity to ensure everything is functioning properly. This lesson covers the essential safety checks that should become second nature before every dive.

## The BWRAF System

Most divers use the BWRAF acronym (pronounced "bee-wraf") to remember the sequence of pre-dive checks:

### B - BCD
- Inflate your BCD fully to check for leaks
- Test both oral and power inflators
- Verify all dump valves function properly
- Ensure proper tank attachment

### W - Weights
- Confirm you have the correct amount of weight
- Check that weight pockets or belt are secure
- Verify quick-release mechanisms function properly
- Make sure weights are balanced appropriately

### R - Releases
- Check all straps and buckles
- Test tank band security
- Ensure emergency quick releases work smoothly
- Verify that knife/tool attachments are secure

### A - Air
- Turn on tank valve fully, then back a quarter turn
- Check tank pressure (should be at least 200 bar/3000 psi for a typical dive)
- Breathe from both primary and alternate air sources
- Monitor your pressure gauge for any drops over 1-2 minutes

### F - Final Check
- Mask: Properly fitted and defog applied
- Fins: Secured correctly
- Signals: Review hand signals with your buddy
- Accessories: Ensure cameras, lights, etc. are secure
- Entry: Discuss entry technique and meeting point underwater

## Buddy Checks

After completing your own checks, perform a reciprocal check with your buddy:

1. **Air**: Check each other's tank valve is fully open
2. **BCD**: Verify inflator hose connection and function
3. **Weights**: Locate and test each other's weight release mechanisms
4. **Releases**: Identify and test all emergency releases
5. **Equipment**: Check for proper hose routing and accessory placement

## Documentation and Planning
Before entering the water, always ensure:

- Dive plan is clearly communicated and understood
- Maximum depth and time limits are agreed upon
- Entry and exit points are identified
- Emergency protocols are reviewed

## Final Safety Considerations

- Never skip the pre-dive safety check, no matter how experienced you are
- Always perform checks even if diving with the same buddy repeatedly
- If you find any equipment issues, no matter how small, address them before diving
- Remember: The few minutes spent on safety checks could save your life

The pre-dive safety check is your last line of defense against equipment-related problems underwater. Make it a sacred ritual that you never compromise.''';
