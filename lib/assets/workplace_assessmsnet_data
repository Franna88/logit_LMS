Safety First
Safety - Ensures hands are clean and free from hand creams, oil and grease
Safety - Ensure no open flames or sparks in work area
Check the cylinder
Safety - Proper Position: Oxygen cylinder securely upright or lying down
Safety - no part of body over cylinder valve
Safety - correct cylinder colour coding and in date
Identifies pillar valve as a pin index or bull nose fitting (Portable systems should be pin index)
Oxygen Clean
Safety - Ensures all components are oxygen clean and designed for safe use with oxygen.
Identify the pillar valve and Pressure Regulator
Safety - Check valve and connections in good condition (no rust)
Checks for Pin Index or bull nose fitting
Checks for intact oxygen washer (Bodok seal)
Checks flow meter dialed to Zero (0) LPM
Aligns Pin Index system correctly to cylinder valve.
Secures Pressure regulator so as to avoid any leaks - DOES NOT OVER TIGHTEN
Opening the Cylinder
Opens 1 turn cylinder pillar valve slowly and ensures safe pressurization of pressure regulator
Checks for leaks or other defects
Turns to full open position
Applies the 1/4 turn back rule
Checks the contents gauge is indicating a full cylinder(in the green)
Selection of Oxygen Delivery Device (Mask)
Conscious - demand valve mask or non rebreather mask (which one is available at the work site)
Correctly connects the oxygen tubing or hose to the appropriate port on the pressure regulator
Correctly connects the oxygen tubing or hose to the appropriate port on the oxygen delivery device
Non - Rebreather Mask - Dial Flow Meter to 15LPM.
Non - Rebreather Mask - Prime the reservoir bag
Demand Valve and Mask - flow is to be kept on Zero (0)
Administration of Oxygen
Place the Oxygen cylinder appropriately and prevents from falling or rolling.
Correctly positions oxygen delivery device to Injured Persons face
Non - Rebreather Mask - Ensure good fit by adjusting the elastics and nose piece
Non - Rebreather Mask - verbalises reservoir bag to remain inflated and in full view and unobstructed by blankets
Demand Valve and Mask - Ensures a perfect face seal otherwise the administration of oxygen will be ineffective.
Reports for Radio Medial Advice and documentation using the Primary Survey (HHHABC/DRsABC
Hazards â€“ Verbalises the Injured Person (IP) is in a safe, ventilated, no smoking area and not close to open flames or sparks
Hello - Verbalise the IP is Alert and Orientated
Help - Verbalises when oxygen was commenced
Airway - Verbalises the Injured Person (IP) can mange their own airway
Breathing - Verbalises the Injured Person (IP) to breathe normally (12-20 breaths per minute)
Circulation - verbalises there are obvious signs of life
Positioning - Verbalise that the Injured Person (IP) can maintain a position of comfort or semi seated position or be placed in shock position (Semi seated with legs elevated)
Rapid assessment - At this stage ensure participant has demonstrated safe use and correct administration of oxygen with in 4 minutes. Then ask them to disassemble the system
Taking oxygen off the Injured Person (discontinuing oxygen)
Remove the oxygen delivery device (mask)
Turn the flow meter on the pressure regulator to Zero (0) LPM
Dismantle, Clean and Re-stock
Closes of the pillar valve of the oxygen cylinder
Open the flow meter to depressurize the system
Ensure all gauges read ZERO (0)
Safely removes the pressure regulator
Discard all used disposable items (no rebreather masks)
Cleans (Decontaminates) all other items
Maintenance, clean and restock
Tags cylinder pressure or send for re-filling
Documentation
Records Time On Oxygen / Time Off Oxygen
Completes required Incident forms and re-stocking forms
Competency
Preformed with basic knowledge and skill and provided oxygen to the Injured Person with in 4 minutes.
Demonstrated safe Oxygen handling and adminstration
I, the assessor, verify the candidate performed this activity with basic understanding of theory and practice with out assistance or direct supervision at an appropriate pace of 4 minutes
Shows understanding of the use of the demand valve and or non rebreather mask for the conscious Injured Person.
