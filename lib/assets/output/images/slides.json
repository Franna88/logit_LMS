    "title": "TYPES OF BURNS (cont.)\n\nELECTRICAL BURNS\nElectrical burns occur when electrical current passes through the body, causing tissue damage. They can affect the skin and deeper tissues, including muscles, nerves, and internal organs. The severity of these burns depends on the type, duration and intensity of electrical exposure.\nLow-voltage burns(<1000volts)-Typically localized to the point of contact. May cause superficial or partial-thickness burns\nHigh-Voltage Burns(>1000volts)- Often result in deep tissue damage and can involve significant internal injuries.\nFlash Burns- Caused by an electrical arc; these do not involve direct contact with electricity but can lead to thermal burns.\nTrue Electrical Burns- Occur when the body becomes part of the electrical circuit, with entry and exit wounds\nLightning Injuries- results from high-voltage discharge in a short duration; they may cause superficial burns, neurological effects, or cardiac arrest.",

They can affect the skin and deeper tissues, including muscles, nerves, and internal organs. The severity of these burns depends on the type, duration and intensity of electrical exposure.\nLow-voltage burns(<1000volts)-Typically localized to the point of contact. May cause superficial or partial-thickness burns\nHigh-Voltage Burns(>1000volts)- Often result in deep tissue damage and can involve significant internal injuries.\nFlash Burns- Caused by an electrical arc; these do not involve direct contact with electricity but can lead to thermal burns.\nTrue Electrical Burns- Occur when the body becomes part of the electrical circuit, with entry and exit wounds\nLightning Injuries- results from high-voltage discharge in a short duration; they may cause superficial burns, neurological effects, or cardiac arrest.",

Irrigate with water. Get product info from MSDS\nHydrofluoric acid- strongest inorganic acid used for industrial purposes. Deeply penetrating i.e, delayed injury.

They can affect the skin and deeper tissues, including muscles, nerves, and internal organs. The severity of these burns depends on the type, duration and intensity of electrical exposure.\nLow-voltage burns(<1000volts)-Typically localized to the point of contact. May cause superficial or partial-thickness burns\nHigh-Voltage Burns(>1000volts)- Often result in deep tissue damage and can involve significant internal injuries.\nFlash Burns- Caused by an electrical arc; these do not involve direct contact with electricity but can lead to thermal burns.\nTrue Electrical Burns- Occur when the body becomes part of the electrical circuit, with entry and exit wounds\nLightning Injuries- results from high-voltage discharge in a short duration; they may cause superficial burns, neurological effects, or cardiac arrest.",

They can affect the skin and deeper tissues, including muscles, nerves, and internal organs. The severity of these burns depends on the type, duration and intensity of electrical exposure.\nLow-voltage burns(<1000volts)-Typically localized to the point of contact. May cause superficial or partial-thickness burns\nHigh-Voltage Burns(>1000volts)- Often result in deep tissue damage and can involve significant internal injuries.\nFlash Burns- Caused by an electrical arc; these do not involve direct contact with electricity but can lead to thermal burns.\nTrue Electrical Burns- Occur when the body becomes part of the electrical circuit, with entry and exit wounds\nLightning Injuries- results from high-voltage discharge in a short duration; they may cause superficial burns, neurological effects, or cardiac arrest.",
