There is no  need to study big words for exams but these are nice to know!\n\nStandards of Care:Everyone has the belief (expectation) that people called to help with an emergency are able to give care with an acceptable (adequate) level of knowledge and skill.  This is referred to as the \u2018Standards of Care\u2019.  This systematic standard approach helps to maintain and improve the quality of care.HHH ABC + Rapid Assessment:Hazards: Hello: Help: Airway: Breathing: Circulation and a rapid assessment to identify obvious injury or illness.Non Rebreather Mask:An oxygen delivery device (face mask) that can be used to continuously administer oxygen to an Injured Person (Alive Diver).Demand Valve Inhalator:An oxygen delivery device (face mask) that can be used to administer oxygen on demand to an Injured Person (Alive Diver).Regurgitation:Passive expulsion of stomach contents (Dead diver - this is dangerous as the Injured Person (IP) can not protect their own airway and may breathe in their own vomit!).Vomiting:Forceful expulsion of stomach contents (Alive Diver - this generally is OK as it means the Injured Person can protect their own airway!).Hypoxia:Lack of (hypo) Oxygen (oxia).Diffusion:Movement of gases.Perfusion:Movement of blood / blood circulation.Ventilation:Process of breathing in and out.\n\nOccasional Gasps or Agonal Respiration:Abnormal breathing pattern caused by the body's attempt to breathe after the heart has stopped.\n\nIt is important to note that that gasping can be mistaken as normal breathing. They key difference is that the gasps are irregular when compared to normal regular breathing. Therefore, always start CPR in an unresponsive person who is gasping.\n\nBasic life support:BLS:The foundation of saving lives after the heart has stopped beating.CPR:Cardiopulmonary ResuscitationAutomated External Defibrillator:AEDAirway Adjunct:Devices to assist keeping the airway open.Barrier Device:A face mask designed to protect the First-Aider from having any contact with the Injured Persons (IP) body fluids!Pocket Mask Resuscitator:A barrier device that can be used to administer breaths to an Injured Person with no life signs (Dead Diver).Bag Valve Mask (BVM) Resuscitator:A barrier device that can be used to deliver breaths to an Injured Person with no life signs (Dead Diver).\n\n2.2.
