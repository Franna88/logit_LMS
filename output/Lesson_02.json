May cause superficial or partial-thickness burns\nHigh-Voltage Burns(>1000volts)- Often result in deep tissue damage and can involve significant internal injuries.\nFlash Burns- Caused by an electrical arc; these do not involve direct contact with electricity but can lead to thermal burns.\nTrue Electrical Burns- Occur when the body becomes part of the electrical circuit, with entry and exit wounds\nLightning Injuries- results from high-voltage discharge in a short duration; they may cause superficial burns, neurological effects, or cardiac arrest.",
